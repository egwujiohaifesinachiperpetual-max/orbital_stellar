> **Status**: Phase 0 — Foundation &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Networks**: testnet + mainnet &nbsp;·&nbsp; **License**: MIT

**Stellar's biggest developer-experience gap isn't a missing API — it's that Horizon's firehose still requires every team to build their own event delivery.**

Orbital ships that delivery layer once, openly: a typed event engine that normalizes Horizon output into application-shaped events, HMAC-signed webhook delivery with retry and edge-runtime verification, and React hooks for live data in the browser. Three MIT-licensed packages, designed to be composed.

## Why this exists

Stellar's official APIs give you the raw firehose — and not much else:

- **Horizon SSE** drops on idle, requires backoff, and surfaces raw operations rather than application-friendly events.
- **Stellar RPC** keeps only ~7 days of Soroban history and has no native subscription model.
- **Webhooks** aren't part of the platform — every project rebuilds HMAC signing, retry, SSRF guards, and edge-runtime verification from scratch.
- **React integration** doesn't exist — every dashboard rebuilds SSE plumbing and lifecycle management.

Every serious Stellar app — wallet, dashboard, anchor integration, agent — re-solves the same problem. Orbital ships those primitives once so you can `pnpm add` them instead of rebuilding them.

The longer-form thesis, the multi-year vision, and the SCF grant case live in [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md), [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md), and `docs/proposal.md` (in progress).

## Packages

| Package | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`@orbital/pulse-core`](./packages/pulse-core) | EventEngine — Horizon subscription, normalization, reconnection, rate-limit handling | ✅ Phase 0 |
| [`@orbital/pulse-webhooks`](./packages/pulse-webhooks) | HMAC-signed webhook delivery + verification (Node + edge runtimes) | ✅ Phase 0 |
| [`@orbital/pulse-notify`](./packages/pulse-notify) | React hooks — `useStellarEvent`, `useStellarPayment`, `useStellarActivity` | ✅ Phase 0 |

> The full classic-operation taxonomy is shipped (payments, account create/merge/options/bump-sequence, trustlines + auth, offers, claimables, liquidity pools, manage-data). Soroban contract events are Phase 1 (Q2–Q3 2026) — see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

---

## Quickstart

> _Packages publish to npm at `v0.1.0` (Phase 0 milestone). Until then, clone the repo and use the workspace install below._

```bash
git clone https://github.com/determined-001/orbital_stellar.git
cd orbital_stellar
pnpm install
```

Once published, install only what you need:

```bash
pnpm add @orbital/pulse-core             # always
pnpm add @orbital/pulse-webhooks         # if you push events to HTTPS endpoints
pnpm add @orbital/pulse-notify react     # if you render live events in React
```

### Subscribe to events directly

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital/pulse-core";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "testnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...YOUR_ACCOUNT");

watcher.on("payment.received", (event) => {
  console.log(`+${event.amount} ${event.asset} from ${event.from}`);
});

watcher.on("*", (event) => {
  // Every event for this address, regardless of type
});
```

### Deliver events to a webhook

```ts
import { EventEngine } from "@orbital/pulse-core";
import { WebhookDelivery } from "@orbital/pulse-webhooks";

const engine = new EventEngine({ network: "mainnet" });
engine.start();

const watcher = engine.subscribe("GABC...");

new WebhookDelivery(watcher, {
  url: "https://your-app.com/hooks/stellar",
  secret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
  retries: 3,
});
```

Receivers verify the signature with `verifyWebhook` (Node) or `verifyWebhookEdge` (Cloudflare Workers / Vercel Edge / Deno / browsers).

### Render live events in React

```tsx
"use client";
import { useStellarPayment } from "@orbital/pulse-notify";

export function IncomingPayments({ address }: { address: string }) {
  const { event, connected } = useStellarPayment(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ORBITAL_URL!,
    address,
  );
  if (!connected) return <p>Connecting…</p>;
  if (!event) return <p>No payments yet.</p>;
  return <p>+{event.amount} {event.asset} from {event.from.slice(0, 8)}…</p>;
}
```

Run it against testnet, send a test payment from the [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org), and you'll see the event print within seconds. The full guide lives at [`apps/web/content/getting-started/quick-start.md`](apps/web/content/getting-started/quick-start.md).

  end

The reference composition — a Next.js route handler that subscribes to an address and streams events as SSE, plus an HMAC-signing route for the on-page webhook demo — lives in [`apps/web/app/api`](apps/web/app/api).

## Production hosting

Two paths:

1. **Build your own backend** — install the SDKs, wire them into your existing Node.js or edge worker, deploy on the infrastructure you already operate. The Next.js route handlers in [`apps/web/app/api`](apps/web/app/api) are a copy-paste reference.
2. **Use Orbital Cloud (in development)** — managed runtime handling multi-region orchestration, persistent webhook registries, replay, and observability. Out of scope for this repository.

---

## Roadmap

- **Now (Phase 0)** — Full classic operation taxonomy, edge-runtime webhook verification, React hooks ✅
- **Q2–Q3 2026 (Phase 1, `v1.0`)** — Soroban event subscription, ABI registry client, cursor persistence, replay adapters, npm publish, stability pledge
- **2027 (Phase 2)** — `@orbital/hooks`, `@orbital/payments`, `@orbital/auth`, first SEP submission
- **2028+ (Phase 3)** — `@orbital/x402`, `@orbital/agent-sdk`, intent compiler

Full multi-year plan in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).
